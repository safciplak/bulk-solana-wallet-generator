# Bulk Solana Wallet Generator

This work generates a specified number of Solana addresses and private keys and saves them to a file.

## Usage
To generate wallets, run the script using the following command:

``` go run main.go ```

The script will prompt you for the number of wallets you want to generate. Enter the desired number and press enter. The script will then generate the specified number of wallets and save them to a file called generated.txt in the project directory.

Each generated wallet will have a private key and a public address. The private key should be kept secret as it allows access to the funds in the wallet. The public address can be shared and is used to receive funds.
